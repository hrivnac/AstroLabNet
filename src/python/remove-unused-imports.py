"""This script reads all .java files from a directory tree and removes unused
import statements. It may have errors in detecting import lines (e.g.  import
lines within block comments, or import lines with another statement in the same
line), and it may have false-negatives when deciding to remove an import (i.e.
it only removes if the last import symbol word doesn't appear at all -
including comments - in the code).

Warning: use it at your own risk. Better have a source control to rollback if
         necessary.
